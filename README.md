What is gRPC? How and what is it used for? While researching whether it can dethrone the rest in the future.
I decided to learn by doing with a project.

I created the this simple playground api.
For now, I have examined the unary, client streaming and server streaming features, and I will go deeper in the future.

So what is gRPC?

gRPC is an open-source project that makes Remote Procedure Call developed by google.
It communicates with binary files instead of JSON or XML and uses HTTP/2 which gives it high speed/low latency and low payload.

It is currently used by companies such as google, netflix, cockroachdb and is seen as the future of microservices.
